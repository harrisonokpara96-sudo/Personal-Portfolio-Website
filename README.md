# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with HTML5 and CSS3. The website showcases my skills, projects, and provides a way for visitors to contact me.

## Project Structure

- index.html - Home page with navigation and introduction
- about.html - About me page with profile information and introduction video
- projects.html - Projects page showcasing my work
- contact.html - Contact form page with validation
- css/style.css - Main stylesheet
- css/mobile.css - Mobile-specific styles
- css/tablet.css - Tablet-specific styles
- images/ - Directory for image assets
- video/ - Directory for video assets

## Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive and uses fluid design with media queries for different screen sizes:

- *Mobile*: Up to 768px - Stacked navigation, centered content, single-column layout
- *Tablet*: 769px to 1024px - Adjusted font sizes and image dimensions for medium screens
- *Desktop*: 1025px and above - Full layout with side-by-side elements where appropriate

### Why These Breakpoints Were Chosen:
- 768px is a common breakpoint for mobile devices as it covers most smartphones in both portrait and landscape orientations
- 1024px is a standard breakpoint for tablets as it covers most tablet devices in portrait orientation
- These breakpoints provide a good balance between device coverage and development efficiency
